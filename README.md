# coursework_2_LIDA

The second piece of coursework for the module __Programming for Social Science: Core Skills GEOG5995M__ required us to develop our own software model which had to:

- Read in some data.
- Process it in some way.
- Display the results.
- Write the results to a file.

My software model was developed in Python but written in Jupyter Notebook so all the results are available in the notebook .ipynb file. To execute the script, you must first:
```
1. Change directory to the same directory as Linear regression.ipynb
2. Type the command: jupyter notebook "Linear regression.ipynb"
```
